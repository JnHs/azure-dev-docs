# Explore Azure Developer CLI Template Galleries

Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) templates simplify the process of building, provisioning, and deploying applications on Azure. This document explores what these templates are, their purpose, and the available galleries, including Awesome AZD and the AI Template Gallery.

## What are Azure Developer CLI templates?

Azure Developer CLI templates are predefined project structures that include application code, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files, and deployment configurations. These templates are designed to help developers quickly set up and deploy full-stack applications on Azure. They provide a starting point for common application architectures and integrate seamlessly with Azure services.

Key features of Azure Developer CLI templates:

- Include infrastructure as code files to create app resources such as like App Service, Azure Functions, and databases
- Define deployment configurations to package and deploy apps built with various languages and frameworks
- Enable simplified, automated workflows for provisioning resources and deploying applications
- Can provide sample starting points or architecture examples for building and managing cloud-native applications

For more detailed information on `azd` templates, visit the [templates overview](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-templates) page.

## What are the Azure Developer CLI template galleries?

Template galleries serve as curated collections of reusable Azure Developer CLI templates. They provide developers with various ready-to-use templates for different use cases, such as web applications, AI-powered solutions, and microservices architectures.

These galleries help developers:

- Quickly prototype and deploy applications
- Explore sample architectures for specific scenarios
- Learn best practices for Azure application development
- Share and build on community-contributed templates
