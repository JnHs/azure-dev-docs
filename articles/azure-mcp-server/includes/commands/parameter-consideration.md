> [!TIP]
> When using the Azure MCP Server, required parameters need to be in the conversation context, but they don't always need to be in the exact prompt you use to call a command. If a parameter like a subscription ID is already established in the conversation context, the MCP Server can use that information without requiring you to repeat it in every prompt. This creates a more natural conversational experience while still ensuring all necessary information is available.
