> [!TIP]
> When using the Azure MCP Server, information needs to be in the conversation context, but they don't always need to be in the exact prompt you use to call a tool. If the information, like a subscription ID, is already established in the conversation context, the MCP Server can use that information without requiring you to repeat it in every prompt. This context creates a more natural conversational experience while still ensuring all necessary information is available.
