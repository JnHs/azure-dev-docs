# What is GitHub Copilot for Azure Preview?

GitHub Copilot for Azure Preview is a GitHub Copilot extension that enables developers to use natural language to:

- Learn about Azure features.
- Deploy Azure resources.
- Get information about Azure resources.
- Diagnose and troubleshoot problems with Azure resources.

GitHub Copilot for Azure is currently available for Visual Studio Code. You must have access to an Azure subscription and be subscribed to GitHub Copilot.

GitHub Copilot is designed to help developers, including those who are new to Azure, to be more productive as quickly as possible. For experienced Azure users, GitHub Copilot for Azure saves time because they can access Azure functionality without needing to look up commands and arguments, and without needing to sign in and browse through the Azure portal.

## Primary scenarios

GitHub Copilot for Azure Preview currently enables four primary scenarios:

|Category|Explanation|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Learn|Learn about Azure services and tools from the latest Microsoft Learn documentation.|<ul><li>"@azure What are the available types of Azure OpenAI models?"</li><li>"@azure What is Azure AI Search and why should I use it?"</li><li>"@azure How does pricing work for Azure SQL?"</li></ul>|

The documentation provides a quickstart and example prompts to help you start using GitHub Copilot for Azure as quickly as possible.

## How it works

GitHub Copilot for Azure Preview is built on a foundational large language model (LLM) like GPT-4o. It supplements the LLM's general knowledge with continuously updated knowledge from Microsoft Learn. Its intelligent agents interact with Azure services, systems, and Azure Resource Graph to carry out specific tasks on your behalf.

The GitHub Copilot Chat extension delivers the chat experience. You can open the chat extension as a pane in Visual Studio Code by selecting the **Chat** icon on the Activity Bar. In the chat pane, you can create a new chat, access a history of chat sessions, open a chat session in a full editor window, and more.
