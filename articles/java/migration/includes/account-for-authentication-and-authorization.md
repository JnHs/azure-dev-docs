### Account for authentication and authorization

Most applications have some kind of authentication and authorization. If you use LDAP for authentication, you can set up Microsoft Entra Domain Services with secure LDAP and configure LDAP connections in WebLogic Server. For more information, see [Create and configure a Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance) and [Configure secure LDAP for a Microsoft Entra Domain Services managed domain](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps).
