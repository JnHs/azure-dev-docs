### Account for the use of JCA adapters and resource adapters

If your existing application uses JCA adapters or other resource adapters to connect to other enterprise systems, ensure that you apply the configuration for these artifacts to the WAS running in Azure Virtual Machines. For more information, see [Relational resource adapters and JCA](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/9.0.5?topic=concepts-relational-resource-adapters-jca) in the IBM documentation.
