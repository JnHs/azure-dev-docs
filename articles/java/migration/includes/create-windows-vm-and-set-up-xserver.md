1. Use the following steps to create a Windows 10 VM from the Azure portal:

   1. Open the resource group you created before in the Azure portal.
   1. Select **Create** to create the resource.
   1. Select **Compute**, search for **windows 10**, and then select **Microsoft Windows 10**.
   1. Select the plan that you want, and then select **Create**.
   1. Use the following values to configure the VM:
      - **Virtual machine name**: **myWindowsVM**
      - **Image**: **Windows 10 Pro**
      - **Username**: **azureuser**
      - **Password**: **Secret123456**
   1. Select the checkbox under **Licensing**.
   1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**.

   It takes a few minutes to create the VM and supporting resources.

   After the deployment finishes, install the X server and use it to configure the application server on the Linux machines by using a graphical interface.

1. Use the following steps to install and launch the X server:

   1. Use Remote Desktop to connect to `myWindowsVM`. For a detailed guide, see [How to connect using Remote Desktop and sign on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-rdp). You must execute the remaining steps in this section on `myWindowsVM`.
   1. Download and install [VcXsrv Windows X Server](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
   1. Disable the firewall. To allow communication from the Linux VMs, use the following steps to turn off Windows Defender Firewall:
      1. Search for and open **Windows Defender Firewall**.
      1. Find **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off**, and then select **Turn off** in **Private network settings**. You can leave **Public network settings** alone.
      1. Select **OK**.
      1. Close the **Windows Defender Firewall** settings panel.
   1. Select **X-launch** from the desktop.
   1. For display settings, set the display number to **-1** to use multiple windows, and then select **Next**.
   1. For **Select how to start clients**, select  **Start no client**, and then select **Next**.
   1. For extra settings, select **Clipboard and Primary Selection**, **Native opengl**, and **Disable access control**.
   1. Select **Next** to finish.

   A **Windows Security Alert** dialog might appear with this message: "Allow VcXsrv windows X-server to communicate on these networks." Select **Allow access**.
