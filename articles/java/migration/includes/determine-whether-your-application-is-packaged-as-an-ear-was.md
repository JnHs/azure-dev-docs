### Determine whether your application is packaged as an EAR

If your application is packaged as an EAR file, be sure to examine the **application.xml**, **ibm-application-bnd.xmi**, and **ibm-application-ext.xmi** files and capture their configurations. For more information, see [Building the enterprise archive (EAR) package on WebSphere](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/configurepricequote/10.0?topic=overview-building-enterprise-archive-ear-package-websphere).
