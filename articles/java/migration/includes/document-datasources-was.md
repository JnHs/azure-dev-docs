### Document datasources

If your application uses any databases, you need to capture the following information:

* What is the datasource name?
* What is the connection pool configuration?
* Where can I find the JDBC driver JAR file?

For more information on JDBC drivers in WAS, see [Using JDBC Drivers with WebSphere Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/9.0.5?topic=concepts-jdbc-providers).
