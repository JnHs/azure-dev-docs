### Document datasources

If your application uses any databases, you need to capture the following information:

* What is the datasource name?
* What is the connection pool configuration?
* Where can I find the JDBC driver JAR file?

For more information on JDBC drivers in WebLogic, see [Using JDBC Drivers with WebLogic Server](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/fusion-middleware/weblogic-server/14.1.2/jdbca/third_party_drivers.html).
