### Inventory differences using IBM migration tools

To move your applications to WebSphere Application Server Liberty or Open Liberty, you need to plan your migration, analyze your applications, and update your source code. IBM provides migration tools to help identify any differences between your current environment and the technologies in your new Liberty environment, such as Java EE 7 or Java EE 8, and Java SE 8 or Java SE 11. For more information, see [Migrating applications to Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/docs/was-liberty/core?topic=migrating-applications-liberty).
