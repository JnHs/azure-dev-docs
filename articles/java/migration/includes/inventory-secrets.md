### Inventory secrets

#### Passwords and secure strings

Check all properties and configuration files on the production server(s) for any secret strings and passwords. Be sure to check **server.xml** and **context.xml** in **$CATALINA_BASE/conf**. You may also find configuration files containing passwords or credentials inside your application. These may include **META-INF/context.xml**, and, for Spring Boot applications, **application.properties** or **application.yml** files.
