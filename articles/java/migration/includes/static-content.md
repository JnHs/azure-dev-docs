#### Read-only static content

If your application currently serves static content, you'll need an alternate location for it. You may wish to consider moving static content to Azure Blob Storage and adding Azure Front Door for lightning-fast downloads globally. For more information, see [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) and [Integrate an Azure Storage account with Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/integrate-storage-account).
