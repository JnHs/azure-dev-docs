### Validate that the supported Java version works correctly

Using Liberty requires a specific version of Java, so you need to confirm that your application runs correctly using that supported version.

The runtime of WebSphere Application Server Liberty has specific requirements for the minimum level of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). For more information, see [Java version dependencies for features](https://www.ibm.com/docs/was-liberty/core?topic=manually-java-version-dependencies-features).

Open Liberty requires a Java SE runtime. It can run by using either a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or a Java SE Development Kit (JDK) distribution. For more information, see [Supported Java SE releases](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/java-se.html).
