### Validate that the supported Java version works correctly

Using WAS on Azure Virtual Machines requires a specific version of Java, so you need to confirm that your application runs correctly using that supported version.

IBM Java 8 comes with the WAS9 distribution. We recommend using the IBM-provided Java JRE. For more information, see [Java SE 8 in WebSphere Application Server traditional V9](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/9.0.5?topic=waso-java-se-8-in-websphere-application-server-traditional-v9).

If you want to switch to a different Java SDK, follow the IBM document [Switching the Java SDK in WebSphere Application Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wsr-and-r/8.5.6?topic=installing-switching-java-sdk-in-websphere-application-server).
