sections:
  - name: FAQ
    questions:
      - question: What's the product scope of the GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java (preview)?
        answer: We recognize that the migration process is always complex and intertwined, with different layers of app ecosystems. At this time, we're limiting the migration scope to Java backend apps.

      - question: Can I use App Modernization for Java to upgrade my Java version?
        answer: There's a separate [GitHub Copilot App Modernization - upgrade for Java (preview)](/java/upgrade/overview) tool, and you can use it together with App Modernization for Java.

      - question: Will App Modernization for Java be open sourced in the future?
        answer: We currently have no plans to open source App Modernization for Java.

      - question: What GitHub Copilot license plan do I need to use App Modernization for Java?
        answer: App Modernization for Java is available to all GitHub Copilot paid plans.

      - question: In addition to Java, I also need to migrate apps written in other languages. Is there a plan for App Modernization to go beyond Java or consolidate with the .NET experience?
        answer: Currently, App Modernization for Java is focused on assisting with Java applications. However, we're actively collecting requirements and feedback from customers regarding the need to support other languages and potentially consolidate with the .NET experience.

      - question: What are the token size limits of the top models?
        answer: For detailed model specifications, see the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot).      
      
      - question: Why do I need to click the **Refresh** button to make some tools available?
        answer: |
         App Modernization for Java uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to provide specialized migration functionalities. When you click the **Refresh** button, it establishes a connection with this server and updates the available tools in the chat agent. This is only necessary when:
         - open a Java project for migration for the first time
         - upgrade the extension to a newer version

      - question: Why does App Modernization for Java stop after listing a plan without making any code changes?
        answer: Sometimes, App Modernization for Java requires explicit confirmation before proceeding. You can type **yes** or **continue** in the chat to enable the agent to move forward with the code modifications.

      - question: Why does App Modernization for Java frequently prompt me to select **Continue**?
        answer: To ensure safer operations, the GitHub Copilot agent repeatedly asks for user confirmation. As a workaround, you can select the dropdown arrow next to the **Continue** button and then select **Always allow**, or update your Visual Studio Code setting `chat.tools.autoApprove` to `true` to automatically approve all tools.

      - question: How can I view more details about the code changes made by the agent?
        answer: The agent always includes explanations for its code changes in the chat window. However, these details might be collapsed in the UI. You can expand the response in the chat to see the full rationale and step-by-step reasoning.

      - question: Why is the code regeneration process unstable?
        answer: App Modernization for Java is powered by AI, so occasional errors might occur. Always review the output carefully before use. You can also retry the regeneration process to see alternative code suggestions.

      - question: Where are formulas stored on the local machine and how can they be shared?
        answer: |
         Predefined formulas are in the following location: **%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\microsoft.migrate-java-to-azure-0.1.0\rag**

         Custom formulas are in the following location: **%USERPROFILE%\.azure\migrate-copilot\custom-rule**

      - question: How do I switch large language models (LLMs)?
        answer: |
         App Modernization for Java currently supports the following three models:

         - `gpt-4o`
         - `claude-3.5-sonnet`
         - `gemini-2.0-flash`

         To switch models, use the following steps:

         1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>.
         1. Select **Preferences: Open Settings (UI)**.
         1. Search for **migrate.java**.
         1. Adjust the **Migrate Java: Model Family** setting.

      - question: Does the tool store my source code?
        answer: |
         No. The tool uses GitHub Copilot in the same way you use it to modify code, which doesn't retain code snippets beyond the immediate session. We don't collect, transmit, or store your custom formulas either.

         Telemetry metrics are collected and analyzed to track feature usage and effectiveness.
