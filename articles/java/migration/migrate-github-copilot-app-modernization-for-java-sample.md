# Asset Manager migration sample

We have prepared a migration code sample, Asset Manager, that stores user-uploaded images and metadata in the following locations:

- RabbitMQ
- Local file system
- AWS S3

You can use GitHub Copilot app modernization for Java (preview) to migrate the app estate to Azure using the following features:

- AppCAT for solution assessment
- Predefined and custom formulas to migrate code and configurations to:

  - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - Azure Service Bus

The sample is available at:
[Asset Manager](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples/blob/workshop/asset-manager/README.md)
