# Concepts

**GitHub Copilot App Modernization - Java on Azure** is a tool covering application migration to Azure end to end, from application assessment, planning, code remediation and build fix. It aims to help you migrate/run your applications to Azure with confidence and accelerate the whole cycle, powered by the artificial intelligence of GitHub Copilot.

**GitHub Copilot App Modernization - Java on Azure** is leveraging **Azure Migrate application and code assessment (AppCAT)** to discover and assess your codes, and usually a good starting point in your app modernization journey. See [AppCAT documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/appcat/java) for more details.

Developers can invoke **GitHub Copilot App Modernization - Java on Azure** to get an overview of the cloud readiness migration issues along with solution recommendations.  
These solutions can include:
- Instructions for setting up Azure resources  
- Following best practices  
- Changing the application code

---

In scenarios where code changes are required, the **App Modernization - Java on Azure** guides developers to the code remediation step.  
At this stage, developers can use predefined formulas for common issues, such as:

- Switching from password-based authentication to **Managed Identities**
- Moving from **AWS S3** to **Azure Blob Storage**

See [link] to learn more about predefined formulas available in the App Modernization Assistant for Java today.

When it comes to development, enterprises often have strict processes and controls.  
This is where **customer-defined formulas** come in.  

Customer-defined formulas are generated by analyzing code commits from an already-migrated application and guide Copilot to remediate code in another app based on the same pattern.  
This enables rapid remediation across multiple applicationsâ€”each successful migration grows the knowledge base and reduces effort for the next.

---

Finally, the **GitHub Copilot App Modernization Assistant for Java on Azure** includes a **Build Fix Agent** designed to help with build-related errors.  
Since AI-based suggestions can sometimes miss a parameter or change a method incorrectly, the Build Fix Agent intervenes to provide support and correction.
