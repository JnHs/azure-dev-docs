## FAQ


## Whatâ€™s the product scope of the Java Migration Copilot?
We recognize the migration process is always complex and intertwined, with different layers of app ecosystems. During private preview, we are limiting the migration scope to Java backend apps.

## Can I use the Java Migration Copilot to upgrade my Java version?
There is a separate [GitHub Copilot assistant for Java upgrade](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/technical-preview-github-copilot-upgrade-assistant-for-java), and you can use it together with the Java Migration Copilot.

## Will the migration copilot be open sourced in the future?
We currently have **no plans to open source** the Java Migration Copilot.

## What GitHub Copilot license plan do I need to use the Java Migration Copilot?
Any plan will work, including the free plan.

## In addition to Java, I also need to migrate apps written in other languages. Is there a plan for the migration copilot to go beyond Java or consolidate with the .NET experience?
Currently, the Java Migration Copilot is focused on assisting with **Java applications**. However, we are actively collecting requirements and feedback from customers regarding the need to support other languages and potentially **consolidate with the .NET experience**.
