# Get Started: Use Managed Identities Instead of Passwords

## Prerequisites
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The latest version is recommended.
- [A GitHub account with GitHub Copilot enabled](https://github.com/features/copilot): All plans are supported, including the Free plan.
- [GitHub Copilot extension in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview): The latest version is recommended.
- [AppCAT](https://aka.ms/appcat-install): Required for the app assessment feature.

## Sign in to use Copilot
To use GitHub Copilot, please sign in to your GitHub account in VSCode. Click the Copilot icon at the top of VSCode to access the GitHub Copilot pane. For more information about setting up GitHub Copilot, refer to [Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

## Installation
In VSCode, open the Extensions view from Activity Bar, search **GitHub Copilot app modernization for Java on Azure** extension in marketplace. Select the **Install** button on the extension. For more information about installing a VSCode extension, refer to [Install a VS Code extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/extensions#_install-a-vs-code-extension). After installation completes, you should see a notification in the bottom-right corner of VSCode confirming success.

## Configuration
In VSCode, configure runtime arguments to enable the proposed API:
```json
  "enable-proposed-api": ["Microsoft.migrate-java-to-azure"],
```
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** and select **Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments**.

3. Restart VSCode.

## Assess cloud readiness
Start your migration process with solution assessment, to understand what your cloud readiness challenges are, how impactful they are and get recommended solutions. A solution can be references to set up Azure resources, adding configurations or making code changes.
1. Clone the [Java migration copilot samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-migration-copilot-samples) repository and open the `mi-sql-public-demo` project folder.
2. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat by clicking the Copilot icon.
3. Type `@migrate-java /assess` (without quotes) and press Enter.
4. Wait for the assessment agent to call Azure AppCat and evaluate the project (this may take several minutes).
5. Review the categorized list of cloud readiness issues.
6. Click **Propose Solution**, choose one or more issue categories, and review details via the information icon.
7. Click **Confirm solution**, then click **Migrate**.

## Apply a predefined formula
The migration Copilot provides predefined formulas for common migration scenarios that you may face when migrating to Azure. In this example youâ€™ll use the Managed Identity formulas to change your Azure SQL database connection from username and password to Azure Managed Identity.
1. After clicking the Migrate button in the Solution Report, Copilot chat window will be opened with Agent Mode.
1. Click **Continue** repeatedly to confirm each tool action in the Copilot Chat window. The Copilot Agent uses various tools to facilitate application modernization. Each tool's usage requires confirmation by clicking the `Continue` button.
1. Review the generated code changes and click **Keep**.

## Apply Build-fix
When the **Java Application Build-Fix** tool is suggested to run, click **Continue** to build the project and fix errors. This tool will attempt to resolve any build errors, in up to 10 iterations.
After the Build-Fix tool begins, click **Continue** to proceed and show progress.


## Next steps
Create and apply your own migration formula.
