# Asset Manager Migration Sample

We have prepared a migration code sample, **Asset Manager**, that stores user-uploaded images and metadata in:

- RabbitMQ  
- Local file system  
- AWS S3  

You can use **GitHub Copilot App Modernization for Java (Preview)** to migrate the app estate to Azure using:

- **AppCAT** for solution assessment  
- Predefined and custom formulas to migrate code and configurations to:
  - **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
  - **Azure Blob Storage**  
  - **Azure Service Bus**  

ðŸ“¦ The sample is available at:
