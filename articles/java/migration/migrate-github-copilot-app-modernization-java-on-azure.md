# Overview

Many enterprises intend to migrate and modernize their application estate to the cloud.  
This journey involves:

- Assessing the current state of the applicationâ€™s code, config, and dependencies  
- Planning Azure resources  
- Remediating issues so apps can be migrated to the cloud

To ease the transition, weâ€™ve previously introduced **Azure Migrate application and code assessment tools for .NET & Java** â€“ aka **AppCAT**.  
However, AppCAT relies on static analysis and is limited to solution assessmentâ€”leaving developers to:

- Select the best fix themselves  
- Manually change the code to remediate issues  
- Verify the app still works

For complex apps, this can take **days or even weeks** of effort.
