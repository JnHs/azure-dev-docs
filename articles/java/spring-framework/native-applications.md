# Spring Boot native image applications

You can use Spring Cloud Azure libraries in [Spring Boot native image applications](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/packaging/native-image/introducing-graalvm-native-images.html).

You need to follow [these instructions](./developer-guide-overview.md#configuring-spring-boot-3) to allow the GraalVM compiler build the native image application.
