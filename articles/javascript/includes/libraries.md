**Libraries for standard JavaScript environments** are listed in the [package index](../azure-sdk-library-package-index.md), and all Azure packages are published under the `@azure` and `@azure-rest` scopes. These packages are maintained by Microsoft and can be found on npm under the publisher [microsoft1es](https://www.npmjs.com/~microsoft1es). This structure enables you to easily provision and manage Azure resources using management libraries (with names starting with `@azure/arm-`) and interact with these resources from your application code.
