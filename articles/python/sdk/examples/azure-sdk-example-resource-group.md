# Example: Use the Azure libraries to create a resource group

This example demonstrates how to use the Azure SDK management libraries in a Python script to create a resource group. (The [Equivalent Azure CLI command](#for-reference-equivalent-azure-cli-command) is given later in this article. If you prefer to use the Azure portal, see [Create resource groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal).)

All the commands in this article work the same in Linux/macOS bash and Windows command shells unless noted.

## 1: Set up your local development environment

If you haven't already, set up an environment where you can run this code. Here are some options:

[!INCLUDE [create_environment_options](../../includes/create-environment-options.md)]

## 2: Install the Azure library packages

Create a file named *requirements.txt* with the following contents:

:::code language="txt" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/resource_group/requirements.txt":::

In a terminal or command prompt with the virtual environment activated, install the requirements:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3: Write code to create a resource group

Create a Python file named *provision_rg.py* with the following code. The comments explain the details:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/resource_group/provision_rg.py":::

### Authentication in the code

Later in this article, you sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI to run the sample code. If your account has permissions to create and list resource groups in your Azure subscription, the code will run successfully.

To use such code in a production script, you can set environment variables to use a service principal-based method for authentication. To learn more, see [How to authenticate Python apps with Azure services](../authentication-overview.md). You need to ensure that the service principal has sufficient permissions to create and list resource groups in your subscription by assigning it an appropriate [role in Azure](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview); for example, the *Contributor* role on your subscription.

### Reference links for classes used in the code

- [DefaultAzureCredential (azure.identity)](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential)
- [ResourceManagementClient (azure.mgmt.resource)](/python/api/azure-mgmt-resource/azure.mgmt.resource.resourcemanagementclient)

## 4: Run the script

1. If you haven't already, sign in to Azure using the Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Set the `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable to your subscription ID. (You can run the [az account show](/cli/azure/account#az-account-show) command and get your subscription ID from the `id` property in the output):

    # [cmd](#tab/cmd)

    ```cmd
    set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    ```

    # [bash](#tab/bash)

    ```bash
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    ```

    ---

1. Run the script:

    ```cmd
    python provision_rg.py
    ```

## 5: Verify the resource group

You can verify that the group exists through the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

- Azure portal: open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups**, and check that the group is listed. If you've already had the portal open, use the **Refresh** command to update the list.

- Azure CLI: use the [az group show](/cli/azure/group#az-group-show) command:

    ```azurecli
    az group show -n PythonAzureExample-rg
    ```

## 6: Clean up resources

Run the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) command if you don't need to keep the resource group created in this example. Resource groups don't incur any ongoing charges in your subscription, but resources in the resource group might continue to incur charges. It's a good practice to clean up any group that you aren't actively using. The `--no-wait` argument allows the command to return immediately instead of waiting for the operation to finish.

```azurecli
az group delete -n PythonAzureExample-rg  --no-wait
```

You can also use the [`ResourceManagementClient.resource_groups.begin_delete`](/python/api/azure-mgmt-resource/azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v2022_09_01.operations.resourcegroupsoperations#azure-mgmt-resource-resources-v2022-09-01-operations-resourcegroupsoperations-begin-delete) method to delete a resource group from code. The commented code at the bottom of the script in this article demonstrates the usage.

### For reference: equivalent Azure CLI command

The following Azure CLI [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command creates a resource group with tags just like the Python script:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/resource_group/provision.cmd":::
