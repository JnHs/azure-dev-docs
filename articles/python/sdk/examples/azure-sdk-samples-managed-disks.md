# Use Azure Managed Disks with the Azure libraries (SDK) for Python

Azure Managed Disks are high-performance, durable block storage designed to be used with Azure Virtual Machines and Azure VMware Solution. Azure Managed Disks provide simplified disk management, enhanced scalability, improved security, and better scaling without having to work directly with storage accounts. For more information, see [Azure Managed Disks](/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview).

You use the [`azure-mgmt-compute`](/python/api/overview/azure/virtualmachines) library to administer Managed Disks for an existing virtual machine.

For an example of how to create a virtual machine with the `azure-mgmt-compute` library, see [Example - Create a virtual machine](azure-sdk-example-virtual-machines.md).

The code examples in this article demonstrate how to perform some common tasks with managed disks using the `azure-mgmt-compute` library. They aren't runnable as-is, but are designed for you to incorporate into your own code. You can consult **Example - Create a virtual machine** to learn how to create an instance of `azure.mgmt.compute ComputeManagementClient` in your code to run the examples.

For more complete examples of how to use the `azure-mgmt-compute` library, see [Azure SDK for Python samples for compute](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-samples-python-management/tree/main/samples/compute) in GitHub.

## Standalone Managed Disks

You can create standalone Managed Disks in many ways as illustrated in the following sections.

### Create an empty Managed Disk

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/empty_disk.py":::

### Create a Managed Disk from blob storage

The managed disk is created from a virtual hard disk (VHD) stored as a blob.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/disk_from_blob.py":::

### Create a Managed Disk image from blob storage

The managed disk image is created from a virtual hard disk (VHD) stored as a blob.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/disk_image_from_blob.py":::

### Create a Managed Disk from your own image

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/disk_from_image.py":::

## Virtual machine with Managed Disks

You can create a Virtual Machine with an implicit Managed Disk for a specific disk image, which relieves you from specifying all the details.

A Managed Disk is created implicitly when creating a VM from an OS image in Azure. In the `storage_profile` parameter, the `os_disk` is optional and you don't have to create a storage account as required precondition to create a Virtual Machine.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/vm_with_managed_disks.py":::

For a complete example on how to create a virtual machine using the Azure management libraries, for Python, see [Example - Create a virtual machine](azure-sdk-example-virtual-machines.md). In the create example, you use the `storage_profile` parameter.

You can also create a `storage_profile` from your own image:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/storage_profile_from_image.py":::

You can easily attach a previously provisioned Managed Disk:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/attach_disk_to_vm.py":::

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Managed Disks

Before Managed Disks, you needed to create a storage account manually for all the VMs you wanted inside your Scale Set, and then use the list parameter `vhd_containers` to provide all the storage account name to the Scale Set RestAPI.

Because you don't have to manage storage accounts with Azure Managed Disks, your `storage_profile` for [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) can now be exactly the same as the one used in VM creation:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/vm_scale_set.py" range="15-22":::

The full sample is as follows:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/vm_scale_set.py":::

## Other operations with Managed Disks

### Resizing a Managed Disk

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/resize_disk.py":::

### Update the storage account type of the Managed Disks

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/update_storage_type.py":::

### Create an image from blob storage

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/create_image_from_blob.py":::

### Create a snapshot of a Managed Disk that is currently attached to a virtual machine

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/create_snapshot.py":::
