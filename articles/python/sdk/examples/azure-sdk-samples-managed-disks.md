# Use Azure Managed Disks with the Azure libraries (SDK) for Python

Azure Managed Disks are high-performance, durable block storage designed for use with Azure Virtual Machines and Azure VMware Solution. They simplify disk management, offer greater scalability, enhance security, and eliminate the need to manage storage accounts directly. For additional details, see [Azure Managed Disks](/azure/virtual-machines/managed-disks-overview).

For operations on managed disks associated with an existing VM, use the [`azure-mgmt-compute`](/python/api/overview/azure/virtualmachines) library.

The code examples in this article demonstrate common operations with Managed Disks using the `azure-mgmt-compute` library. These examples are not meant to be run as standalone scripts, but rather to be integrated into your own code. To learn how to create a `ComputeManagementClient` instance from `azure.mgmt.compute` in your script, see [Example - Create a virtual machine](azure-sdk-example-virtual-machines.md).

For more complete examples of how to use the `azure-mgmt-compute` library, see [Azure SDK for Python samples for compute](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-samples-python-management/tree/main/samples/compute) in GitHub.

## Standalone Managed Disks

The following examples show different ways to provision standalone Managed Disks.

### Create an empty Managed Disk

The following example demonstrates how to create a new empty managed disk. This approach is useful when you need a blank disk to attach to a virtual machine or to use as a base for creating snapshots or images.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/empty_disk.py":::

### Create a Managed Disk from blob storage

The following example demonstrates how to create a Managed Disk from a virtual hard disk (VHD) stored as a blob in Azure Blob Storage. This approach is useful when you have a VHD file that you want to convert into a Managed Disk.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/disk_from_blob.py":::

### Create a Managed Disk image from blob storage

The following example demonstrates how to create a managed disk image using a VHD stored as a blob. This approach is useful when you want to create a reusable image from an existing VHD file.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/disk_image_from_blob.py":::

### Create a Managed Disk from your own image

The following example demonstrates how to create a new managed disk by copying an existing managed disk. This approach is useful when you want to create a new disk based on an existing one, such as for scaling out or creating backups.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/disk_from_image.py":::

## Virtual machine with Managed Disks

You can create a virtual machine with an implicitly created managed disk based on a specific disk image, eliminating the need to manually define all disk details.

A Managed Disk is created implicitly when creating a VM from an OS image in Azure. The `storage_profile.os_disk` parameter can be omitted, and there's no need to pre-create a storage accountâ€”Azure handles these details for you

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/vm_with_managed_disks.py":::

For a complete example showing how to create a virtual machine using the Azure management libraries for Python, see [Example - Create a virtual machine](azure-sdk-example-virtual-machines.md). This example demonstrates how to use the `storage_profile` parameter.

You can also create a `storage_profile` from your own image:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/storage_profile_from_image.py":::

You can easily attach a previously provisioned Managed Disk:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/attach_disk_to_vm.py":::

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets with Managed Disks

Before Azure Managed Disks, you had to manually create a storage account for each VM in your Virtual Machine Scale Set and use the `vhd_containers` parameter to specify those storage accounts in the Scale Set REST API.

With Azure Managed Disks, storage account management is no longer required. As a result, the `storage_profile` for [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview) used for Virtual Machine Scale Sets can now match the one used for individual VM creation:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/vm_scale_set.py" range="15-22":::

The full sample is as follows:

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/vm_scale_set.py":::

## Other operations with Managed Disks

### Resizing a Managed Disk

The following example demonstrates how to resize an existing Managed Disk. This is useful when you need to increase the size of a disk to accommodate more data or applications.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/resize_disk.py":::

### Update the storage account type of the Managed Disks

The following example demonstrates how to update the storage account type of an existing Managed Disk. This is useful when you want to change the performance characteristics of the disk, such as switching from Standard to Premium storage.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/update_storage_type.py":::

### Create an image from blob storage

The following example demonstrates how to create a Managed Disk image from a VHD stored in Azure Blob Storage. This is useful when you want to create a reusable image from an existing VHD file, which can then be used to create new virtual machines.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/create_image_from_blob.py":::

### Create a snapshot of a Managed Disk that is currently attached to a virtual machine

The following example demonstrates how to create a snapshot of a Managed Disk that is currently attached to a virtual machine. This is useful for creating backups or restoring points of the disk's state.

:::code language="python" source="~/../python-sdk-docs-examples/managed_disk/create_snapshot.py":::
