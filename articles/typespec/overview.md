# What is TypeSpec?

[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/)  is a powerful and flexible language developed by Microsoft for describing APIs. It allows developers to define APIs in a way that is both extensible and easy to understand. TypeSpec can be used to generate OpenAPI specifications and other API description formats through a feature called emitters. Emitters interact with the TypeSpec compiler to produce various artifacts, transforming TypeSpec definitions into different output formats. 

One of the key features of TypeSpec is its support for libraries of reusable components. This makes TypeSpec definitions more concise and ensures compliance with API guidelines. The TypeSpec standard library includes an OpenAPI emitter, which ensures compatibility with existing tooling and workflows. 

TypeSpec is open source and can be used to describe any API, not just Azure APIs. This makes it a versatile tool for API developers, architects, and managers who need to deliver high-quality APIs in a complex and evolving environment. 

Benefits of TypeSpec:

* **Simplifies API Development**: TypeSpec streamlines the process of building service APIs by providing a clear and concise way to define them. This helps developers focus on the logic and functionality of their APIs rather than getting bogged down in the details of API specifications. 

* **Ensures Compliance**: By using libraries of reusable components, TypeSpec ensures that API definitions adhere to established guidelines and standards. This reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies in API design. 

* **Enhances Compatibility**: The inclusion of an OpenAPI emitter in the TypeSpec standard library ensures that TypeSpec definitions are compatible with existing tools and workflows. This makes it easier for developers to integrate TypeSpec into their current development processes. 

* **Supports Extensibility**: TypeSpec’s flexible and extensible nature allows developers to customize and extend their API definitions as needed. This makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of API development scenarios. 

* **Facilitates Transition**: For Azure service teams, transitioning from OpenAPI to TypeSpec offers several benefits, including simplified API development and easier API reviews. This makes TypeSpec an attractive option for teams looking to modernize their API development processes. 

Open Source and Community-Driven: As an open-source project, TypeSpec benefits from contributions and feedback from the developer community. This ensures that the language continues to evolve and improve based on real-world use cases and requirements. 

## API design is challenging

TypeSpec addresses common challenges in API design, governance, and implementation:

- **Complex Specifications**: Writing, reviewing, and maintaining API specifications can be cumbersome. Even a simple API can result in hundreds of lines of specification code.
- **Protocol Diversity**: Each protocol has its own specification format, with no shared design language across protocols. This fragmentation complicates the development process.
- **Governance Issues**: Without a unified design language, governing APIs becomes difficult, leading to inconsistencies in implementation and quality.
- **Scalability Concerns**: As the number of APIs or API versions increases, more engineering teams are required, which can lead to coordination challenges and inefficiencies.

By addressing these challenges, TypeSpec simplifies the API design process, ensures consistency across different protocols, and enhances overall governance and scalability.

## TypeSpec is an API design language 

TypeSpec is an API design language. Design your API with TypeSpec, then generate the protocol specification with the TypeSpec CLI. 

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        ```typespec
        @resource("pets")
        model Pet {
          @key("petId")
          id: int32;
        
          name: string;
          tag?: string;
        
          @minValue(0)
          @maxValue(20)
          age: int32;
        
          ownerId: int64;
        }
        ```
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        ```
        /pets:
            post:
                ...
            get:
                ...
        /pets/{petId}:
            get:
                ...
            patch:
                ...
            delete:
                ...
        ```
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Write TypeSpec once, emit to multiple specification formats such as OpenAPI, JSON, or Protobuf. Separating the design language from the API specification allows TypeSpec to provide a single design to snap into the existing downstream protocols and tool chains. Downstream tools include REST service generation, SDK generation per programming language, reference documentation, and testing.

## Enforces governance with reuse and modular design 

TypeSpec allows you to transform API patterns into reusable elements, enhancing both the quality and uniformity of your API interface. By designing reusable elements, you eliminate the need for multiple teams to define the same functionality, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency across your APIs.

Examples of reusable elements include:

- **Parameters**: Define common types, requirements, and validation rules to ensure consistent parameter usage across APIs.
- **Authentication**: Specify allowed authentication methods to standardize security practices.
- **Versioning**: Implement a common versioning paradigm to manage API versions effectively.
- **Responses**: Ensure consistent response shapes and requirements to provide a uniform experience for API consumers.
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling to consistently return information that helps resolve issues without exposing security or internal details.

For example, you can create a reusable library of common TypeSpec elements, such as types, decorators, emitters, and linters. This library can be shared across teams to maintain consistency and streamline the development process.

## Service-Side code generation with TypeSpec 

In addition to client code generation, TypeSpec also supports service-side code generation. This feature allows developers to generate server-side stub code directly from TypeSpec definitions, streamlining the development process and ensuring consistency across client and server implementations. 

TypeSpec’s service-side code generation capabilities include: 

* **Model Generation**: TypeSpec serves as the source of truth for APIs, making model generation from TypeSpec emitters a natural progression. The prototype emitter in C# embraces a canonical service model instead of a single-client model approach, generating mapping code between versioned and canonical models. 

* **Standard Runtime Interfaces**: The standard emitter for TypeSpec focuses on generating standard runtime interfaces initially, rather than behaviors. This approach ensures flexibility and allows for easy integration with various runtime stacks. 

* **Custom Code Extensibility**: TypeSpec’s emitters offer custom code extensibility, allowing developers to tailor the generated code to their specific needs. This makes it easier to adapt the generated code to different environments and use cases. 

* **Comprehensive Code Generation**: TypeSpec supports code generation that spans a modern development stack, from clients to servers and everything in between. This includes generating code for different protocols and asset types, ensuring a unified development approach. 

By leveraging TypeSpec’s service-side code generation capabilities, developers can significantly reduce the amount of manual coding required, improve consistency across their API implementations, and enhance overall productivity. 

## Interoperability with industry toolchain

TypeSpec seamlessly integrates with existing industry toolchains, ensuring interoperability, and enhancing productivity. By generating OpenAPI specifications from TypeSpec definitions, developers can use a vast ecosystem of tools designed for OpenAPI, such as Swagger for API documentation, Postman for API testing, and Azure API Management for deploying APIs. This includes configuring API gateways, generating client and server code, and validating API data. This compatibility allows teams to maintain their current workflows while benefiting from the structured and consistent API design that TypeSpec provides.
